title: AI generated text as lorem ipsum
---

While working on something that neede a few paragraphs of descriptive text, I used chatGPT to generate this text.

As expected, the text wasn't really what I was hoping for. As you probably know, AI-generated text often sounds / reads as something contrived or artificial.

However, it occured to me that the generated text was useful in the sense that it provided the correct amount of text, similar to what you would do with lorem ipsum text.

Rather than being nonsense, which you get with lorem ipsum, it was at least coherent and to the point.

A coherent lorem ipsum text.
